## Course Description

This course will cover advanced and state-of-the-art machine learning for text data. ML methods covered will include graphical models, Bayesian inference, nonparametric models, and deep learning. By the end of the course, students will be able to

- Understand important concepts in NLP
- Read current research papers in NLP
- Implement some of the basic ML models for NLP
- Conduct replication studies based on a recent NLP+ML paper
- Communicate in written and spoken English about NLP+ML research

## Time
- Mon/Wed 10:30 - 12:00

## Course Addition
We decided not to approve requests for course addition. We ask for your kind understanding regarding this matter.

## Prerequisites  

- You need to have good programming skills in Python.
- You need to have a basic understanding of ML concepts. You do not need to have taken CS376 or any other undergraduate ML course, but you need to know concepts such as train vs test data, clustering vs classification, accuracy/precision/recall, overfitting, and basic classification models such as SVM, random forest, etc. You can learn these concepts as we go along, but you may find some lectures and papers difficult to understand if you do not put in extra time to learn these concepts.
- We will use well-known frameworks for machine learning. You may start with little prior experience and learn these libraries during this semester, but that will require extra time and effort. Note that we do not provide any lectures about learning them.
- The topic of the course includes Korean NLP. You do not need to be fluent in Korean, but you need to know what the Korean alphabet (Hangeul) is and how they combine to form syllables and words.

## Materials

- Papers from JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, IJCAI, AAAI, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, ArXiv, etc.

## Homeworks (Subject to Change)
1. BOW
1. RNN Family
1. BERT

## Attendance and Participation
Sometimes (expect about 12 times during the semester), we will have a "quiz" in class. The grade will be 0 or 1, so if you turn in an answer, you will get credit. The format will be different for each class. If you miss up to 2 classes, there will be no penalty. After 2, points will be taken off. Because you can miss up to 2 for free, we will not take any excuses for missing the class (unless you have a special case, such as prolonged sickness, in which case you should email the teaching staff).

## Team Projects

- You will form teams of *three or four*, and as a team, pick one NLP paper from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, TACL, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published in 2018 to 2021, and replicate it. You will be required to change at least one thing -- dataset, model, or research question. More details will be given out during the first week of class.

- Homework 30%
- Attendance & Participation 10%
- Team Project 50% 
  - Proposal 5%
  - Paper presentation 10%
  - Final presentation 20%
